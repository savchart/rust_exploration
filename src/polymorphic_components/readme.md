`polymorphism.rs` provides examples of different dispatching methods in Rust: static dispatch, dynamic dispatch, and enum dispatch.

### Static Dispatch

The example of static dispatch uses a generic function that takes an input parameter with a type that implements the WalkableStatic trait. The CatStatic and DogStatic structs both implement this trait, and the generic function is used to call the walk method on instances of these structs.


### Dynamic Dispatch
In the dynamic dispatch example, the function takes a reference to a trait object (&dyn WalkableDynamic). This function can thus accept any type that implements WalkableDynamic. The CatDynamic and DogDynamic structs implement this trait and the function is used to call the walk method on instances of these structs.

### Enum Dispatch
The enum dispatch example showcases a different approach. Instead of using traits, we define an Animal enum with Cat and Dog variants. A walk method is implemented for the Animal enum that matches the variant and executes the corresponding behavior.

### Conclusion
These examples illustrate different ways of achieving polymorphism in Rust. Each method has its own advantages and trade-offs in terms of performance and flexibility.
